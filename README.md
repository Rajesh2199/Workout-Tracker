#  Nosql Project/MONGODB: Workout Tracker


## Overview

* This application makes use of Node.js / Express.js , and MONGODB on the backend and HTML/CSS on the front end. User can click on Add Workout to add a new workout or Continue workout to continue the previously added workout. The app is deployed in heroku and you can find the link below. 

* The main purpose of this project was to test my MONGODB knowledge. I was able to fully understand how to connect the mongodb database using moongoose.connect() method. Similarly, the queries such as  add, update, find and delete in mongo are now very clear to me.
